# unbounties

A repository for recording unbounties

## What

An unbounty is prize set for work on a topic, that is judged by a set of people. It contrasts to a bounty in that it could be for any work on the topic, writing, art, evangelism or concrete action.

To start with unbounties will be recorded here.

## Why

To allow people to surprise people in the performance of activity. To encourage autonomy in solving problems.  To allow people to commit to funding things they don't want to or can't describe exactly.

## Example

I'm going to set an unbounty on the topic of unbounties. 

## How to get involved

Ask to be added to the organisation or create a pull request against this repository. 

This will allow you to set unbounties by adding them below.

To pay out an unbounty create a PR with how much you want paid out and to whom. The PR will only be merged if there is evidence of the unbounty being paid attached to the PR.
